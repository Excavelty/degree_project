                p Topology visualiser is a tool for watching typical topological objects and animations showing transformations between some of the homeomorphic objects. The idea originated due to lack of similiar tools allowing not only to watch transformation, but also change camera's perspective, select its speed or zooming in/out. 
                p User may select one of the predefined animations of transformations between two homeomorphic objects by using navbar on the top of the page or by using carousel menu on the left.
                p By selecting option 'Object list' from the navbar, user will open viewer of some of the topological objects.
                p The project was created as a part of engineering degree thesis by Wojciech Gomu≈Çka (Wojciech.Gomulka@fis.agh.edu.pl)
